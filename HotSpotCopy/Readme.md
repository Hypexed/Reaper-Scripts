### HotSpot Copy and Paste.

Copy an item or time selection and remember cursor position as hot spot.

This allows you to copy an item or time selection relative to the cursor position. If you wish to copy an item surrounding a beat and paste it around another beat this will allow you to do this. It's useful for when the song tempo varies.

Two scripts are provided. One for HotSpot Copy and the other for HotSpot Paste. I find it useful to bind the scripts to a toolbar button.

A time selection can be made or an item can be selected. Place the cursor where you would like the hot spot to be. And run the HotSpotCopy action to copy it. Now place the cursor to where you want your hot spot paste to be at. And run the HotSpotPaste action. Voila! It was pasted around the hot spot. :-)
